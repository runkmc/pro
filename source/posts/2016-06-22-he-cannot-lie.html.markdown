Welcome to the Island of Knights, Knaves, and Sir Mix-a-lot! There are a
few things you should know about this island: READMORE

-    Knights *always* tell the truth
-    Knaves *always *lie
-    There is exactly one knight named “Sir Mix-a-lot”. Like every other knight, he cannot lie.

You run into three inhabitants on the island. Earlier in the day, a
friend of yours (a knight, so we know his statements to be true) told
you that one of these three is Sir Mix-a-lot. They make the following
statements to you:

**A:** At least one of the three of us is a knave   
**B:** C is a knight.

Keeping in mind that there is exactly one knight named Sir Mix-a-lot,
which one of the three is he?

&nbsp;

## The Solution:

First, we need to figure out what A is.
Let's say he is a knave and is therefore lying. That would make his
statement about at least one of them being a knave true, so we have a
contradiction. It's impossible for A to be a knave in this case, so he
must be a knight. That means that either B or C (or possibly both) has
to be a knave.

With that in mind, let's look at B's statement. He claims that C is a
knight. If that's true, then that makes B a knight as well for making a
true statement. We know that can't be the case, however, since we know
from A that at least one of them is a knave. B's statement has to be
false, because if it were true it would be a contradiction. We now know
B to be a knave and the statement he made to be false. Therefore B and C
are both knaves, and A is the knight named Sir Mix-a-lot.

just me.
